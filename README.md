Air Pollutants
There are two main types of air pollutants: primary and secondary. Most air pollutants come from burning fossil fuels. Some come from burning forests. Some are due to the evaporation of chemicals.
Types of Air Pollutants
There are two basic types of pollutants in the air. They are known as primary pollutants and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants enter the air directly. Some are released by natural processes, like ash from volcanoes. Most are released by human activities.
•	Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn.
•	Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants.
•	Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine. This happens when coal that contains sulfur burns.
•	Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead. Mercury comes from smokestacks. Both metals have industrial uses.
•	Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds, such as methane. VOCs are released by many human activities. Raising livestock, for example, produces a lot of methane.
•	Particulates are solid particles. These particles may be ash, dust, or even animal wastes. Many are released when fossil fuels burn.


Secondary pollutants form from primary pollutants. Many occur as part of photochemical smog. This type of smog is seen as a brown haze in the air. Photochemical smog forms when certain pollutants have a chemical reaction in the presence of sunlight. Photochemical smog consists mainly of ozone (O3). Ozone near the ground is a pollutant. This ozone is harmful to humans and other living things. However, ozone in the stratosphere protects Earth from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.
In 2004, the National Environment Protection Council made the National Environment Protection (Air Toxics) Measure which addresses the five priority air toxics: benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylenes and benzo (a) pyrene (as a marker for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).
